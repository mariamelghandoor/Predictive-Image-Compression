# Predictive Image Compression
A Java program for compressing and decompressing grayscale images using predictive coding and quantization.
## Features

* Converts RGB images to grayscale
* Supports three prediction methods: Adaptive 2D, First-Order, and Second-Order
* Quantizes prediction errors for compression
* Calculates compression ratio and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Saves compressed data and reconstructed images

## Requirements

1. Java 8 or higher
2. Input images in BMP format

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-image-compression.git
```

2. Compile and run:javac App.java

```
java App
```

3. Follow the menu to compress or decompress images, selecting prediction method and quantization levels.
